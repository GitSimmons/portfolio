# Portfolio

Open source because I should probably care about green squares.

It has a couple neat features such as:

- Synchronized scrolling image containers

Yep, that's it.

## Instructions

`yarn dev` and that's about it. Works just like most Next apps.

## Attributions

The header for this project was inspired by https://www.juliacodes.com/ ,
though inspiration is a strong word because really, I more or less stole it.

The portfolio project sections are based on Pookage's awesome design, visible at: https://pookage.dev/portfolio
